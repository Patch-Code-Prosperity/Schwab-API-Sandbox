## Introduction 📖
This repository provides a mock server for the Schwab API, allowing developers to test their applications without making real API calls. This is particularly useful for development while your app is stuck in "approved-pending"

### Getting Started
If you are just getting started developing your app, or have not yet begun, use [Pythonic Schwab API](https://github.com/Patch-Code-Prosperity/Pythonic-Schwab-API) for a quick start.

## Requirements 🛠️
- Node.js (Download [here](https://nodejs.org/))
- Prism by Stoplight

## Installation 🔧

### Installing Prism
Prism can be installed globally via npm, which requires Node.js to be pre-installed on your system (see above). You can run the following command in your terminal to install Prism:

This command works on Windows, macOS, and Linux as long as npm is available on your system.

```bash
npm install -g @stoplight/prism-cli
```

## Usage 📝

### Starting the Mock Server
To start the mock server for each API product on your local machine, run:
For Market Data API:
```bash
prism mock -h 0.0.0.0 -p 4010 ./market_data_openapi.yml
```
For Account and Orders API:
```bash
prism mock -h 0.0.0.0 -p 4020 ./account_orders_openapi.yml
```
You **can** run both at once.

This starts the Prism mock server(s), listening on all network interfaces at port 4010 and/or 4020, and will reply as if it were the Schwab API server (in most cases). This is provided without warranty and **will** become out of date.

### Modifying API Calls
To use the sandbox environment, modify the base URL in your API calls. Examples of different configurations are provided below:

#### Environment Variable
If using an `.env` file:
```
API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:4020
API_MARKET_URL=http://localhost:4010
```

#### Hardcoded Variable
Modify the base URL directly in your code:
```javascript
const baseUrl = "http://localhost:4020";
const marketUrl = "http://localhost:4010";
```

#### Adding a Sandbox Parameter
If you want to toggle between live and sandbox environments dynamically:
```javascript
let baseUrl = isSandbox ? "http://localhost:4020" : "https://api.schwabapi.com";
let marketUrl = isSandbox ? "http://localhost:4010" : "https://api.schwabapi.com";
```

## Contributing 🤝
Contributions to the sandbox are welcome. Make a PR or open an issue.

## Support 💬
If this project has helped you, please give it a star ⭐ 

Know someone else struggling to develop their Schwab app? Send them a link to this repo — it's great for people who are still "approved-pending" and cannot authenticate to the official API if they want to start developing!
